# Memory Game

Memory game that you flip two cards and if they are matched, they'd be kept open, otherwise, they will flip back

if you exceed 10 moves then you'd loose one star, and you loose another star each 10 moves.

after you match all the cards, then you get a congrats message with your stars and the time you've took to finish the game.
